I couldn't understand much because he wasn't answering my questions online, but you could find unique elements by calling a key,
since each key maps to a unique value.

HashMaps have their keys ordered arbitrarily and is implemented by an array of linked lists. TreeMaps have their keys ordered. You can iterate through the keys in sorted order.

Therefore, you would use TreeMaps if the keys were ordered.
